you only have to use 'heroku create' once in the new repo, then deploy the app with changes 'git push heroku master'
you can connect the app with github for auto deployment by going in apps settings

To test app locally I can use(where main is the python file name containing code):
uvicorn --port 5000 --host 127.0.0.1 main:app --reload
